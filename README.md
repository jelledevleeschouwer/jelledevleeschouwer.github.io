# [ðŸš€ elpee.io](https://elpee.io/)

## Getting started

This website is derived from the [astrowind template](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind) using [Astro 4.0](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It focuses on simplicity, good practices and high performance.

In this version the template supports all the options in the `output` configuration, `static`, `hybrid` and `server`, but the blog only works with `prerender = true`. We are working on the next version and aim to make it fully compatible with SSR.

### Project structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                             |

| `npm install`         | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`         | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`       | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `npm run preview`     | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
